## My AIESEC Journey üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚Äç‚û°Ô∏è

In October 2018, I embarked on a journey that would fundamentally reshape who I am. I joined AIESEC ‚Äîa global youth-led organization‚Äî without knowing that this step would help me transform from a shy introvert into someone capable of standing confidently in front of hundreds of people. It was through this experience that I discovered new sides of my personality and began a process of continuous growth that still shapes me today.

##### From Introvert to Extrovert (Well, Kind Of)

When I first joined AIESEC in my hometown of Monastir, I attended a local conference that brought together more than 60 people from different backgrounds. That weekend changed everything. For the first time, I was sharing ideas, experiences, even personal stories, with people I had just met. It broke the ice not just between us, but inside me.

I started as a marketing member in October 2018, learning the hard skills of design, content creation, and how to analyze and target the student market, our main audience. But the true value came from the soft skills I was gaining without even realizing it: time management, conflict resolution, task prioritization, teamwork, and the ability to adapt to diverse personalities.

##### Leading for the First Time

After three months as a member, I applied to become a **Team Leader** in the marketing department. I worked closely with the Vice President of Marketing, other team managers, and had the chance to lead my own team. That year was packed with milestones. One of the biggest achievements was organizing an event that gathered **over 800 attendees** in under a month.

I was honored to be named *Member of the Month* multiple times, not just for performance, but for my engagement, commitment, and passion.

##### A Summer of Culture and Impact

By summer 2019, I took on the role of **Content and Logistics Coordinator** for our incoming exchange program. We hosted young people from more than 18 countries. My mission was to ensure they had a meaningful and smooth experience volunteering in Tunisia. That summer taught me more than any course ever could. I learned cultural sensitivity, logistics management, and how to provide transformative experiences to people from all walks of life.

##### YouthSpeak & The Power of Purpose

Later that year, I participated in the **YouthSpeak Forum**, an event for young people to voice ideas about achieving the **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)** by 2030. It was inspiring to see so many people dedicated to creating positive change, and it reminded me that my voice, and everyone else‚Äôs matters when it comes to building a better future.

##### Navigating COVID with Creativity

2020 brought a new challenge: COVID-19. The pandemic disrupted everything, including AIESEC‚Äôs international exchange programs. But in the middle of chaos, I saw an opportunity to serve differently.

I initiated and organized one of the **first online events in Tunisia** focused on **personal well-being during lockdown**. Over two days, we invited:
- A **psychologist** to speak about mental resilience.
- A **fitness coach** to guide us through home workouts.
- A **life coach** to help us build positive daily routines.
- A **nutritionist** to teach healthy eating habits.

The event was a massive success because it addressed something most people overlooked at the time: the **emotional and physical health** of others. While everyone was focused on self-preservation, we chose empathy.

##### Skills That Last a Lifetime

Besides soft skills like communication, leadership, and team management, I also walked away with tangible hard skills that opened freelance opportunities for me. Thanks to AIESEC, I developed abilities in:
- Graphic design  
- Photography  
- Videography  
- Event planning  
- Sponsorship acquisition  
- Public speaking  
- Feedback delivery  

In fact, I even got involved in **filmmaking** afterward, something I never imagined doing before AIESEC.

##### Looking Back with Gratitude

From October 2018 to January 2021, I lived an experience that went far beyond volunteering. AIESEC helped me unlock my potential, challenge my limits, and become a better version of myself. I‚Äôll always be proud and grateful to have been part of the world‚Äôs largest student movement.

And if AIESEC ever needs me again, I‚Äôll be there. Because I needed AIESEC once, and it changed my life.
