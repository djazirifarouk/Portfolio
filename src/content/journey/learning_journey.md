In August 2017, I began my higher education journey at the <a href="https://ipeim.rnu.tn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Preparatory Engineering Institute of Monastir</strong>, Tunisia</a>, with a focus on **MP (Math√©matiques‚ÄìPhysique)**.  
The **MP program** is an intensive and highly selective curriculum in Tunisia's preparatory schools designed to foster strong foundations in:

- Advanced Mathematics  
- Classical and Modern Physics  
- Algorithmic and Programming Basics 
- Chemistry and advanced system design
- Languages 
- Scientific Reasoning and Proof Techniques  
- Time and Priority Management under Pressure  

During these two years, I developed essential life skills such as:  

- **Effective problem-solving**  
- **Time management and prioritization**  
- **Self-discipline under pressure**  
- **Mental resilience and adaptability**  

After two years of rigorous preparation, I sat for the **National Engineering Entrance Exam** in May 2019.  
In July 2019, I successfully ranked **507 out of 1600**, earning admission to one of Tunisia‚Äôs top engineering schools.
