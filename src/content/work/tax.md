## North Africa Taxes

### Project Overview üìå
This project focused on **collecting tax data** across North African countries to incorporate it into the **Cost and Freight (CNF) data**, enabling the calculation of product prices after customs clearance. The ultimate goal was to facilitate a **comparison between imported product prices and local product prices**.

#### Data Collection üåü
- Gathered tax data for the North African region, including:
  - **Tunisia**
  - **Egypt**
  - **Morocco**
  - **Algeria**
- Consolidated taxation information by **product type** and **origin**.

#### Analytical Insights üí°
- Conducted **analytical scenarios** to evaluate product pricing from different origins after including relevant taxes.
- Identified the **impact of taxation** on the final cost of imported goods compared to local products.

#### Challenges Faced ‚ö°
- **Lack of Historical Data:** Encountered difficulty accessing historical taxation data for the countries involved.
  - Reached out to government authorities for assistance but received no response.
  - Proceeded with **current taxation data** as a workaround.

#### Tools and Skills Utilized üõ†Ô∏è
- **Data Analysis:** Aggregation and analysis of taxation data across regions.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Price comparison of imported and local products.
- **Scenario Building:** Evaluating cost implications based on different taxation policies.
- **Cross-Regional Data Management:** Handling diverse taxation structures across multiple countries.
