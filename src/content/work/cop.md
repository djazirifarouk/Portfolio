## USA Cost of Agriculture Production

### Project Overview 📌
The output dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of the production costs of various commodities across the United States. It offers insights into profitability and return on investment (ROI) for farmers, particularly in the **Farmer Selling Economics** section.

### Data Collection 🔁
- Gathered data from **over 15 universities** across various states in the USA.
- Developed **consolidated and mapping pipelines** to harmonize diverse datasets for seamless merging.
- Conducted a **business study** prior to data scraping to ensure relevant mapping and alignment with project objectives.

#### Price Analysis 💰
- Collected flat prices for major commodities like **corn** and **soybeans** across the United States.
- Compared prices with production costs to evaluate profitability and ROI.

#### Key Metrics 🔨
- Focused on **corn** and **soybeans** due to their competitive nature in the U.S. market.
  - Explored the trade-off between planting corn and soybeans.
- Examined variables such as:
  - Land rental costs.
  - Machinery expenses.
  - Revenue and profit margins.
- Factored in soil types, irrigation, tillage methods, and crop rotation.

####  Challenges Faced 💪
- **Data Variety**: Consolidating data from diverse sources and formats.
- **Mapping Complexity**: Ensuring accurate mapping by integrating domain knowledge.
- **Pipeline Configuration**: Building customized pipelines for each source to ensure data consistency.

#### Automation and Reporting 🤖
- Implemented automation to ensure **seamless updates** to the data pipelines.
- Regularly generate **summary reports** for clients, detailing market updates and changes reflected in the dashboard.
- Provided **scenario-based insights** based on yield forecasts to create more valuable reports for clients, supporting data-driven decision-making.

### Dashboard Insights 📈
The dashboard enables clients to:
- Compare production costs with market prices.
- Assess profitability across various commodities and conditions.
- Visualize key metrics such as land rent, machinery expenses, and revenue for each scenario.
