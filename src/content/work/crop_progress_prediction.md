## Crop Progress Prediction Model

### Project Overview üìå
The **Crop Progress Prediction Model** project aims to forecast the progress of various crops such as **corn**, **wheat**, **sugar beet**, and **soybeans**. By integrating historical crop progress data with environmental factors like **precipitation**, **temperature**, and **NDVI** (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), this project provides **accurate predictions for the next three reporting periods**.

#### Data Collection and Preprocessing üåü
- **Aggregated historical data** from multiple sources for different crops and regions.
- Mapped diverse crop stages for each product and country, addressing the **variability in crop stages** and definitions across regions.
- Differentiated crops by **seasonality** and **multi-cropping systems**, accounting for countries with multiple crops per year.
- Created a robust dataset integrating **weather patterns** and **NDVI metrics** for predictive modeling.

#### Challenges and Solutions üîç
- **Variability in Crop Stages:** Different countries and crops have unique growth stages.
  - **Solution:** Conducted an in-depth business analysis to standardize and map the stages for accurate comparison.
- **Inconsistent Crop Periods:** Countries with multiple crops in a year posed a challenge.
  - **Solution:** Implemented season-specific data segmentation to handle overlapping growth cycles effectively.

#### Machine Learning Implementation ü§ñ
- Built a **predictive model** using **XGBoost**, focusing on:
  - Crop progress metrics.
  - Weather data (precipitation and temperature).
  - Yield relationships with NDVI.
- Trained the model to provide **high-accuracy forecasts** for the next three crop progress releases.

#### Insights Delivered üìà
- Correlated weather conditions and NDVI with crop growth, enabling stakeholders to anticipate and adapt to changing agricultural conditions.
- Delivered actionable predictions for planning and resource allocation in agriculture.

### Tools and Skills Utilized üõ†Ô∏è
- **Python:** Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model implementation.
- **XGBoost:** Predictive modeling for high-accuracy crop progress forecasting.
- **Pandas and Numpy:** Data wrangling and transformation.
- **Scikit-learn:** Model evaluation and validation.
- **Matplotlib and Plotly:** Visualizing relationships between crop progress and influencing factors.
- **Data Integration:** Combined datasets from diverse sources into a unified framework.
- **Domain Expertise:** Leveraged agricultural knowledge for accurate stage mapping and scenario differentiation.

### Outcome üèÜ
Successfully developed a predictive model capable of forecasting crop progress for the next three reporting periods. The project delivers valuable insights into the relationship between crop growth, weather, and NDVI, supporting informed decision-making for farmers, agronomists, and policymakers.
