## Global Tenders Analysis

### Project Overview üìå
This project involved analyzing global tender data to provide insightful visualizations and reporting for clients. The data process encompassed **extracting, transforming, and consolidating data** from diverse sources, structuring it to meet client needs, and delivering actionable insights through comprehensive dashboards.

#### Data Processing üìà
- Extracted tender data from unstructured text files using Python.
- Identified common patterns to transform data into a structured format.
- Consolidated data from various sources, including clients and external platforms.

#### Insights and Dashboards üí°
1. **News Page**:
   - Displayed the latest tenders for each product and country.
