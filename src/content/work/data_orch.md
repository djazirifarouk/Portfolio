### Project Overview 📖
This project focuses on the automation of unstructured data processing pipelines using **artificial intelligence** and **workflow orchestration**. It was conducted as part of my supervision with my intern in **Data Engineering and Decision Systems**.  

The system ingests heterogeneous raw data sources, applies **AI/NLP models for information extraction**, runs **automated validation checks**, and continuously feeds structured outputs into **real-time dashboards**. This ensures a scalable, reliable, and low-latency pipeline, significantly reducing the need for manual intervention.

---

### Objectives 🎯
- Automate the ingestion and transformation of large-scale unstructured datasets.  
- Apply AI-based extraction models to parse and structure key information.  
- Ensure data reliability through automated quality control mechanisms.  
- Deploy pipelines using scalable and reproducible technologies.  
- Provide interactive visualization through continuously updated dashboards.

### Approach and Methodology 🔬

#### 1. Data Ingestion 📥
- Automated collection from multiple heterogeneous sources.  
- Handling of different formats (PDF, CSV, scraped text).  

#### 2. Information Extraction 🤖
- Utilized **NLP techniques** to extract relevant fields.  
- Integrated custom parsing models for complex document structures.  

#### 3. Data Validation ✅
- Implemented automated anomaly detection and consistency checks.  
- Applied rule-based and statistical methods to enforce data quality.  

#### 4. Storage & Processing 🗄️
- Structured datasets stored in relational databases.  
- Optimized schema design for efficient querying and integration.  

#### 5. Visualization 📊
- Processed outputs automatically streamed to **Power BI dashboards**.  
- Interactive exploration enabled for monitoring and analysis.  

#### 6. Workflow Orchestration & Deployment 🚀
- **Apache Airflow** used for scheduling and monitoring pipelines.  
- **Docker** employed for containerization and reproducible deployments.
