## Supply and Demand Analysis of USA

### Project Overview 📌
This project focused on analyzing and comparing **forecasted and actual supply and demand data** for the United States. The goal was to consolidate insights from multiple sources to create a unified dashboard that offers a **comprehensive historical and forecasted analysis** for various supply and demand items such as **production, carry-in, carry-out, exports, and yield**.

#### Data Collection 📥
- **Scraped historical data** from published PDF articles and aggregated them into a single, structured DataFrame.
- Differentiated between various publications to ensure accurate tracking of changes over time.

#### Data Mapping 🔗
- Mapped supply and demand items across three sources to maintain consistency and uniformity across datasets.  
- Standardized naming conventions and ensured alignment between historical and forecasted data.

#### Comparative Analysis 📉
- Compared forecasted values from three sources to actual results, highlighting deviations and trends.  
- Explored historical changes to identify **relationships between supply and demand items** across sources.

#### Advanced Insights 📐
- Conducted correlation analysis between:
  - Historical and forecasted data for the same source.
  - Published articles from the current year and the previous year.
- Created **scatter plots** and calculated **R² values** for trend lines to evaluate relationships using Power BI and DAX.

#### Dashboard Creation 📊
- Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard to:
- Visualize historical supply and demand data for each item.
- Track changes over time across different sources.
- Provide actionable insights into forecast accuracy and relationships between data points.
