## Agricultural Production Cost Analysis

### Project Overview 📌
This project focuses on building an automated system to collect, clean, standardize, and visualize cost-of-production data for multiple agricultural commodities across the United States. It leverages Power BI for geospatial visualization and comparative analysis using data pipelines and advanced mapping logic.

---

### Data Ingestion and Pipeline Design 🔁
- Aggregated structured data from more than a dozen public academic sources.
- Developed modular data pipelines for:
  - Normalization of cost metrics.
  - Geospatial mapping to states and regions.
  - Scenario-specific parameter tagging (e.g., irrigation, tillage).
- Applied SQL CTEs and dynamic joins to harmonize datasets with varied schema.

---

### Cost Transformation 💰
- Ingested time-series price data for commodities.
- Engineered transformations to:
  - Align prices and costs by region and crop.
  - Enable comparative views through Power BI visuals.
- Designed calculations for derived indicators such as cost-per-acre and profitability margins.

---

### Metric Engineering 🔨
- Computed and exposed multiple derived metrics:
  - Land lease costs.
  - Equipment and operational expenses.
  - Crop rotation and yield-specific cost scenarios.
- Parameterized inputs for dynamic scenario analysis.

---

### Key Technical Challenges 💪
- **Heterogeneous Sources**: Standardizing multiple formats and structures.
- **Mapping Accuracy**: Creating robust logic to associate raw data with geographies.
- **Pipeline Modularity**: Tailoring ETL logic for region-specific transformations.

---

### Automation & Reporting 🤖
- Scheduled automated updates for new data ingestion and processing.
- Generated visual outputs directly via Power BI with automated refresh cycles.
- Enabled export-ready reporting by integrating key indicators and variations.

---

### Dashboard Capabilities 📈
The dashboard supports:
- Regional comparisons of production metrics.
- Visualization of cost factors by geography.
- Scenario-based filtering (e.g., crop type, soil condition, operational method).

### Future Enhancements 🚀
- Onboard additional crops and economic indicators.
- Integrate deeper scenario modeling with probabilistic forecasting modules.
